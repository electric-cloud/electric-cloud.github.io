  <p>ElectricFlow allows you to plug in the tools you already use as part of your software delivery process, to add a layer of automation and governance to your tool chain.

               <ul>
               <li>Get started faster: simply plug-in, configure, and you're done</li>
               <li>Use pre-developed, tested and proven integrations for the the most common tools</li>
               <li>Streamline your workflows with templetized, tested, patterns for the most popular processes</li>
            <li>Extend or change the ElectricFlow UI to suit the needs of your internal users</li>
            <li>Plugins can be used to encapsulate your logic and version it, for easy reuse and sharing across environments.</li>
