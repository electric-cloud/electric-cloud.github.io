    <h3 class="center-content__title">What is a Plugin?</h3>
    <p>
        A plugin is a collection of one or more features that can be added to ElectricFlow. A plugin is delivered as a JAR
        file containing the feature(s) implementation. When a plugin is installed, the ElectricFlow server extracts the JAR
        contents to disk into a configurable plugins directory. A plugin has an associated ElectricFlow project that can
        contain procedures and properties required by the implementation.

    <h3 class="center-content__title">What can a plugin do?</h3>
    <p>
        You can add any number of plugins to ElectricFlow, depending on the additional functionality you would like to
        add to the product.
        <br/><br/>
        A plugin can add:

        <ul>
            <li>New tabs for the ElectricFlow UI</li>
            <li>New product pages - for example, to integrate another software product you want to use in conjunction
                with ElectricFlow
            </li>
            <li> A configuration page, specific to plugin implementation requirements</li>
            <li>A plugin can contain its own help topic to provide specific information to users about the plugin</li>
            <li>A re-write of existing tabs or pages to incorporate one or more special functions you need</li>
            <li>A place where scripts “live” on the web server so other plugins can use them</li>
            <li>Also, it is possible to replace virtually every page in the ElectricFlow UI, with the exception of the ElectricFlow
                login screen.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
